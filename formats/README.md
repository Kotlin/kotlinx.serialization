# Serialization formats

This area of repository contains different libraries with various add-on formats which
were not included in the main runtime library â€“ because they are not so popular, or they're big,
or they contain other JVM runtime dependencies.

For convenience, they have same groupId, versioning and release cycle as main runtime.

## HOCON config parser

* Artifact id: `kotlinx-serialization-runtime-configparser`
* Since version: 0.4.1
* Platform: JVM only

Allows deserialization of `Config` object from popular [lightbend/config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) library 
into Kotlin objects.
You can learn about "Human-Optimized Config Object Notation" or HOCON from library's [readme](https://github.com/lightbend/config#using-hocon-the-json-superset).

## Other community-supported formats

### YAML

* GitHub repo: [charleskorn/kaml](https://github.com/charleskorn/kaml)
* Artifact ID: `com.charleskorn.kaml:kaml`
* Platform: JVM only

Allows serialization and deserialization of objects to and from [YAML](http://yaml.org).

### Bson

* GitHub repo: [jershell/kbson](https://github.com/jershell/kbson)
* Artifact ID: `com.github.jershell:kbson`
* Platform: JVM only

Allows serialization and deserialization of objects to and from [BSON](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/).

### XML
* GitHub repo: [pdvrieze/xmlutil](https://github.com/pdvrieze/xmlutil)
* Artifact ID: `net.devrieze:xmlutil-serialization`
* Platform: JVM, Android, JavaScript

This library allows for reading and writing of XML documents with the serialization library.
It is multiplatform, but as the xmlutil library (which handles the multiplatform xml bit) 
delegates to platform specific parsers each platform needs to  be implemented for each platform 
specifically. The library is designed to handle existing formats that use features that would 
not be available in other formats such as JSON.
