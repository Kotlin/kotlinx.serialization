# Serialization formats

This area of repository contains different libraries with various add-on formats which
were not included in the main runtime library â€“ because they are not so popular, or they're big,
or they contain other JVM runtime dependencies.

For convenience, they have same groupId, versioning and release cycle as main runtime.

## HOCON config parser

* Since version: 0.4.1
* Platform: JVM only
