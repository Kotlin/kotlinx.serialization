/**
 * Represents naming strategy — a transformer for serial names in a [Json] format.
 * Transformed serial names are used for both serialization and deserialization.
 * A naming strategy is always applied globally in the Json configuration builder
 * (see [JsonBuilder.namingStrategy]).
 *
 * Actual transformation happens in the [serialNameForJson] function.
 * It is possible to apply additional filtering inside the transformer using the `descriptor` parameter in [serialNameForJson].
 *
 * Original serial names are never used after transformation, so they are ignored in a Json input.
 * If the original serial name is present in the Json input but transformed is not,
 * [MissingFieldException] still would be thrown. If one wants to preserve the original serial name for deserialization,
 * one should use the [JsonNames] annotation, as its values are not transformed.
 *
 * ### Common pitfalls in conjunction with other Json features
 *
 * * Due to the nature of kotlinx.serialization framework, naming strategy transformation is applied to all properties regardless
 * of whether their serial name was taken from the property name or provided by @[SerialName] annotation.
 * Effectively, it means one cannot avoid transformation by explicitly specifying the serial name.
 *
 * * Collision of the transformed name with any other (transformed) properties serial names or any alternative names
 * specified with [JsonNames] will lead to a deserialization exception.
 *
 * * Naming strategies do not transform serial names of the types used for the polymorphism, as they always should be specified explicitly.
 * Values from [JsonClassDiscriminator] or global [JsonBuilder.classDiscriminator] also are not altered.
 *
 * ### Controversy about using global naming strategies
 *
 * Global naming strategies have one key trait that makes them a debatable and controversial topic:
 * They are very implicit. It means that by looking only at the definition of the class,
 * it is impossible to say which names it will have in the serialized form.
 * As a consequence, naming strategies are not friendly to refactorings. Programmer renaming `myId` to `userId` may forget
 * to rename `my_id`, and vice versa. Generally, any tools one can imagine work poorly with global naming strategies:
 * Find Usages/Rename in IDE, full-text search by grep, etc. For them, the original name and the transformed are two different things;
 * changing one without the other may introduce bugs in many unexpected ways.
 * The lack of a single place of definition, the inability to use automated tools, and more error-prone code lead
 * to greater maintenance efforts for code with global naming strategies.
 * However, there are cases where usage of naming strategies is inevitable, such as interop with an existing API or migrating a large codebase.
 * Therefore, one should carefully weigh the pros and cons before considering adding global naming strategies to an application.

public fun interface JsonNamingStrategy {
    /**
     * Accepts an original [serialName] (defined by property name in the class or [SerialName] annotation) and returns
     * a transformed serial name which should be used for serialization and deserialization.
     *
     * Besides string manipulation operations, it is also possible to implement transformations that depend on the [descriptor]
     * and its element (defined by [elementIndex]) currently being serialized.
     * It is guaranteed that `descriptor.getElementName(elementIndex) == serialName`.
     * For example, one can choose different transformations depending on [SerialInfo]
     * annotations (see [SerialDescriptor.getElementAnnotations]) or element optionality (see [SerialDescriptor.isElementOptional]).
     *
     * Note that invocations of this function are cached for performance reasons.
     * Caching strategy is an implementation detail and should not be assumed as a part of the public API contract, as it may be changed in future releases.
     * Therefore, it is essential for this function to be pure: it should not have any side effects, and it should
     * return the same String for a given [descriptor], [elementIndex], and [serialName], regardless of the number of invocations.

         * A strategy that transforms serial names from camel case to snake case — lowercase characters with words separated by underscores.
         * The descriptor parameter is not used.
         *
         * **Transformation rules**
         *
         * Words' bounds are defined by uppercase characters. If there is a single uppercase char, it is transformed into lowercase one with underscore in front:
         * `twoWords` -> `two_words`. No underscore is added if it was a beginning of the name: `MyProperty` -> `my_property`. Also, no underscore is added if it was already there:
         * `camel_Case_Underscores` -> `camel_case_underscores`.
         *
         * **Acronyms**
         *
         * Since acronym rules are quite complex, it is recommended to lowercase all acronyms in source code.
         * If there is an uppercase acronym — a sequence of uppercase chars — they are considered as a whole word from the start to second-to-last character of the sequence:
         * `URLMapping` -> `url_mapping`, `myHTTPAuth` -> `my_http_auth`. Non-letter characters allow the word to continue:
         * `myHTTP2APIKey` -> `my_http2_api_key`,  `myHTTP2fastApiKey` -> `my_http2fast_api_key`.
         *
         * **Note on cases**
         *
         * Whether a character is in upper case is determined by the result of [Char.isUpperCase] function.
         * Lowercase transformation is performed by [Char.lowercaseChar], not by [Char.lowercase],
         * and therefore does not support one-to-many and many-to-one character mappings.
         * See the documentation of these functions for details.
