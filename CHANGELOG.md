v0.5.1 / 2018-06-13
===================

  Plugin:
  
  * Fix 1.2.50 compatibility
  * Workaround for recursive resolve on @Serializable(with) and @Serializer(for) pair annotations
  * Don't generate additional constructor if @SerialInfo has no properties
  * Fix order of resolving serializers: user-overriden should go before polymorphic and default
  * While creating descriptors, add type arguments not from serializable class definition but from actual KSerializer implementation. This provides better support for user-defined or external generic serializers
  * Don't generate constructor for passing generic serializers if user already defined proper one.
  * Respect `@Serializable(with)` on properties on JS too.
  * Fix for Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/136
  * Fix for Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/125
  * Fix for Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/118 
  * Fix for Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/123: resolve annotation parameters in-place
  	
  Runtime:
  
  * Added some shorthands for standard serializers
  * Fix for bug #141 that uses an extra boolean to determine whether to write a separating comma rather than assuming that the element with the index 0 is written first(or at all) in all cases.
  * Move mode cache to output class to make .stringify stateless and thread-safe (#139)
  * Bugfix #95: Can't locate default serializer for classes with named coâ€¦ (#130)
  * Updated versions in docs and examples Add changelog
