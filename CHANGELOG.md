1.0.0-RC / 2020-08-17
==================

Release candidate for 1.0.0 version. The goal of RC release is to collect feedback from users
and provide 1.0.0 release with bug fixes and improvements based on that feedback.

While working on 1.0.0 version, we carefully examined every public API declaration of the library and 
split it to stable API, that we promise to be source and binary-compatible, 
and experimental API, that may be changed in the future.
Experimental API is annotated with `@ExperimentalSerializationApi` annotation, which requires opt-in.
For a more detailed description of the guarantees, please refer to the [compatibility guide](docs/compatibility.md).

The id of the core artifact with `@Serializable` annotation and `Json` format was changed
from `kotlinx-serialization-runtime` to `kotlinx-serialization-core` to be more clear and aligned with other kotlinx libraries.

A significant part of the public API was renamed or extracted to a separate package.
To migrate from the previous versions of the library, please refer to the [migration guide](docs/migration.md).

0.20.0 / 2020-03-04
==================

### Release notes

0.20.0 release is focused on giving a library its final and stable API shape. 

We have carefully evaluated every `public` declaration and
decided whether it should be publicly available. As a result, some declarations were deprecated with an intention of removing
them from public API because they are going to be replaced with others, more valuable and useful for users. 

Deprecated symbols include: 
 - Pre-defined JSON instances like `nonStrict` — `strictMode` was split to 3 separate, more granular, flags.
Users are encouraged to create their own configuration; 
 - Top-level serializers like `IntSerializer` and `ArrayListSerializer`.
They were replaced with constructor-like factory functions.
 - `SerialClassDescImpl` creation class replaced with `SerialDescriptor` 
builder function to ease writing of custom serializers and maintain `SerialDescriptor` contract.
 - Internal utilities, like HexConverter and ByteBuffer, were deprecated as not relevant to serialization public API.
 - Add-on formats like Protobuf, CBOR and Properties (formerly Mapper)
are now extracted to [separate artifacts](formats/README.md#protobuf) to keep the core API lightweight.

We have spent a lot of effort into the quality,
documenting most of the core interfaces, establishing their contracts,
fixing numerous of bugs, and even introducing new features that may be useful for those of you who
write custom serializers — see [JsonTransformingSerializer](docs/json_transformations.md).  

Such API changes, of course, may be not backwards-compatible in some places, in particular, between compiler plugin and runtime.
Given that the library is still is in the experimental phase, we took the liberty to introduce breaking changes in order to give users
the better, more convenient API. Therefore, this release has number `0.20.0` instead of `0.15.0`;
Kotlin 1.3.70 is compatible _only_ with this release.

To migrate: 
1. Replace `import kotlinx.serialization.internal.*` with `import kotlinx.serialization.builtins.*`.
This action is sufficient for most of the cases, except primitive serializers — instead of using `IntSerializer`, use `Int.serializer()`.
For other object-like declarations, you may need to transform it to function call: `ByteArraySerializer` => `ByteArraySerializer()`.
 
2. Pay attention to the changed `JsonConfiguration` constructor arguments: instead of `strictMode`,
now three different flags are available: `ignoreUnknownKeys`, `isLenient`, and `serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues`.

3. If you used formats other than JSON, make sure you've included the corresponding artifact as dependency,
because now they're located outside of core module. See [formats list](formats/README.md) for particular artifact coordinates.

4. Other corresponding deprecation replacements are available via standard `@Deprecated(replaceWith=..)` mechanism.
(use Alt+Enter for quickfix replacing).
