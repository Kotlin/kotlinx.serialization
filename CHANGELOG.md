v0.11.0 / 2019-04-12
====================

#### Plugin:

  * **Semantic change**: Now properties with default values are @Optional by default, and properties without backing fields are @Transient by default.
  * Allow '@Serializable' on a type usage (fixes #367)
  * Auto-applying @Polymorphic for interfaces and serializable abstract classes
  * Do not enable PolymorphicSerializer without special annotation
  * Fix missing optionality of property when generating descriptor in Native

  * Support Serializable class hierarchies on Native and JS
  * Replace @Optional with @Required

#### Runtime:
  * Introduce JsonBuilder and JsonConfiguration as a better mechanism for configuring and changing configuration of the JSON
  * Implement polymorphic serialization in JSON using class discriminator key
  * Force quoting for map keys (fixes #379)

  * Remove obsolete and poorly designed global class cache. Remove JVM-only PolymorphicSerializer
  * Replace old SerialModule with new one which: - Can not be installed, should be passed in format constructor - Has polymorphic resolve and contextual resolve - Has DSL for creation - Immutable, but can be combined or overwritten
  * Improve error message for unknown enum constant
  * Deprecate @Optional, introduce @Required
  * Use long instead of int in JsonLiteralSerializer

  * Make JsonElementSerializer public
