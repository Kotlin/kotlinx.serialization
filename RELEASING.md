# kotlinx.serialization release checklist

To release new `<version>` of `kotlinx.serialization`:

1. Checkout `dev` branch and update:<br>
   `git checkout dev && git pull`

3. Make sure the `master` branch is fully merged into `dev`:<br>
    `git merge origin/master`

4. Search & replace `<old-version>` with `<version>` across the project files. Should replace in:
   * [`README.md`](README.md)
   * [`gradle.properties`](gradle.properties)
   * [`integration-test/gradle.properties`](integration-test/gradle.properties)

   Update Kotlin version, if necessary.

5. Write release notes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md):
   * Use old releases as example of style.
   * Write each change on a single line (don't wrap with CR).
   * Study commit message from previous release.

    [git changelog](https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/master/Commands.md#git-changelog) from git-extras may help you with that.

6. If necessary, commit your changes to a new branch called `<version>-release` and send it for review, then merge it to `dev` branch.<br>
If review is not required, commit directly to `dev`.

6. Tag version:<br>
    `git tag v<version>`

8. Push your changes:<br>
   `git push origin dev && git push origin --tags`

1. On [TeamCity integration server](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/project.html?projectId=KotlinTools_KotlinxSerialization&tab=projectOverview):
   * Wait until "Runtime library (Build â€“ Aggregated)" configuration for committed `dev` branch passes tests.
   * Run "Runtime library (Deploy - Train)" configuration:
     * On 'Changes' tab, select `dev` branch and corresponding commit.
     * On 'Parameters' tab, find 'Deploy version' and fill in with `<version>`.

4. In [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories) admin interface:
   * Close the repository and wait for it to verify.
   * Release it.
   
5. Set a new value for [`KOTLINX_SERIALIZATION_RELEASE_TAG`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-site/blob/master/.teamcity/BuildParams.kt),
   creating a pull request in the website's repository. To find out why it is needed, [read this](#kotlinxserializationreleasetag).

6. Create a new release in [Github releases](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/releases). Use created git tag for title and changelog message for body.

1. Switch back to master branch and update it:<br>
   ```
   git checkout master && git pull
   git merge --ff-only dev
   git push origin master
   ```

5. Announce new release in [Slack](https://kotlinlang.slack.com).

# API reference documentation

The [API reference documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.serialization/) is built and deployed automatically
for every commit in `master`, typically within the same day.

**Note**: KDoc / API reference changes targeting `master` should not contain information which is irrelevant to or is 
incorrect in relation to the latest release, because these changes will be deployed live automatically, and they might
confuse readers.

The build configuration responsible for assembling the documentation can be found
[on TeamCity](https://buildserver.labs.intellij.net/buildConfiguration/Kotlin_KotlinSites_KotlinlangTeamcityDsl_KotlinxSerializationBuildApiReference).

### KOTLINX_SERIALIZATION_RELEASE_TAG

The generated API reference documentation has the library version specified in the header. By default, the value
of the `version` project property is taken. However, this property usually contains the upcoming version with
the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix, so it cannot be used if you want to publish the updated documentation of the latest release.

For this reason, the [`KOTLINX_SERIALIZATION_RELEASE_TAG`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-site/blob/master/.teamcity/BuildParams.kt)
property must be set during every release: its value will be used for all subsequent publications of the API docs to kotlinlang.org,
and it will appear in the header.
