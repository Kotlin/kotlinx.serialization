/**
 * Serial descriptor is an inherent property of [KSerializer] that describes the structure of the serializable type.
 * The structure of the serializable type is not only the property of the type, but also of the serializer as well,
 * meaning that one type can have multiple descriptors that have completely different structure.
 *
 * For example, the class `class Color(val rgb: Int)` can have multiple serializable representations,
 * such as `{"rgb": 255}`, `"#0000FF"`, `[0, 0, 255]` and `{"red": 0, "green": 0, "blue": 255}`.
 * Representations are determined by serializers and each such serializer has its own descriptor that identifies
 * each structure in a distinguishable and format-agnostic manner.
 *
 * ### Structure
 * Serial descriptor is identified by its [name][serialName] and consists of kind, potentially empty set of
 * children elements and additional metadata.
 *
 * * [serialName] uniquely identifies the descriptor (and the corresponding serializer) for non-generic types.
 *   For generic types, the actual type substitution is omitted from the string representation and the name
 *   identifies the family of the serializers without type substitutions. However, type substitution is accounted
 *   in [equals] and [hashCode] operations, meaning that descriptors of generic classes with the same name, but different type
 *   parameters, are not equal to each other.
 *   [serialName] is typically used to specify the type of the target class during serialization of polymorphic and sealed
 *   classes, for observability and diagnostics.
 * * [Kind][SerialKind] defines what this descriptor represents: primitive, enum, object, collection et cetera.
 * * Children elements are represented as serial descriptors as well and define the structure of the type's elements.
 * * Metadata carries additional potentially useful information, such as [nullability][nullable], [optionality][isElementOptional]
 *   and [serial annotations][getElementAnnotations].
 *
 * ### Usages
 * There are two general usages of the descriptors: THE serialization process and serialization introspection.
 *
 * #### Serialization
 * Serial descriptor is used as bridge between decoders/encoders and serializers.
 * When asking for a next element, the serializer provides an expected descriptor to the decoder, and,
 * based on the descriptor content, decoder decides how to parse its input.
 * In JSON, for example, when the encoder is asked to encode the next element and this element
 * is a subtype of [List], the encoder receives a descriptor with [StructureKind.LIST] and, based on that,
 * first writes an opening square bracket before writing the content of the list.
 *
 * Serial descriptor _encapsulates_ the structure of the data, so serializers can be free from
 * format-specific details. `ListSerializer` knows nothing about JSON and square brackets, providing
 * only the structure of the data and delegating encoding decision to the format itself.
 *
 * #### Introspection
 * Another usage of a serial descriptor is type introspection without its serialization.
 * Introspection can be used to check, whether the given serializable class complies the
 * corresponding scheme and to generate JSON or ProtoBuf schema from the given class.
 *
 * ### Indices
 * Serial descriptor API operates with children indices.
 * For the fixed-size structures, such as regular classes, index is represented by a value in
 * the range from zero to [elementsCount] and represent and index of the property in this class.
 * Consequently, primitives do not have children and their element count is zero.
 *
 * For collections and maps, though, indices does not have fixed bound. Regular collections descriptors usually
 * have one element (`T`, maps have two, one for keys and one for values), but potentially unlimited
 * number of actual children values. Valid indices range is not known statically
 * and implementations of descriptor should provide consistent and unbounded names and indices.
 *
 * In practice, for regular classes it is allowed to invoke `getElement*(index)` methods
 * with an index within `0 until elementsCount` range and element at the particular index corresponds to the
 * serializable property at the given position.
 * For collections and maps, index parameter for `getElement*(index)` methods is effectively bound
 * by the maximal number of collection/map elements.
 *
 * ### Thread-safety and mutability
 * Serial descriptor implementation should be immutable and, thus, thread-safe.
 *
 * ### Equality and caching
 * Serial descriptor can be used as a unique identifier for format-specific data or schemas and
 * this implies the following restrictions on its `equals` and `hashCode`:
 *   *
 *
 * An [equals] implementation should use both [serialName] and elements structure.
 * Comparing [elementDescriptors] directly is discouraged,
 * because it may cause a stack overflow error, e.g. if a serializable class `T` contains elements of type `T`.
 * To avoid it, a serial descriptor implementation should compare only descriptors
 * of class' type parameters, in a way that `serializer<Box<Int>>().descriptor != serializer<Box<String>>().descriptor`.
 * If type parameters are equal, descriptors structure should be compared by using children elements
 * descriptors' [serialName]s, which correspond to class names
 * (do not confuse with elements own names, which correspond to properties names); and/or other [SerialDescriptor]
 * properties, such as [kind].
 * An example of [equals] implementation:
 * ```
 * if (this === other) return true
 * if (other::class != this::class) return false
 * if (serialName != other.serialName) return false
 * if (!typeParametersAreEqual(other)) return false
 * if (this.elementDescriptors().map { it.serialName } != other.elementDescriptors().map { it.serialName }) return false
 * return true
 * ```
 *
 * [hashCode] implementation should use the same properties for computing the result.
 *
 * ### User-defined serial descriptors
 * The best way to define a custom descriptor is to use [SerialDescriptor] builder function, where
 * for each serializable property corresponding element is declared.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * // Class with custom serializer and custom serial descriptor
 * class Data(
 *     val intField: Int, // This field is ignored by custom serializer
 *     val longField: Long, // This field is written as long, but in serialized form is named as "_longField"
 *     val stringList: List<String> // This field is written as regular list of strings
 * )
 *
 * // Descriptor for such class:
 * SerialDescriptor("my.package.Data") {
 *     // intField is deliberately ignored by serializer -- not present in the descriptor as well
 *     element<Long>("_longField") // longField is named as _longField
 *     element("stringField", listDescriptor<String>())
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * For a classes that are represented as a single primitive value, [PrimitiveSerialDescriptor] builder function can be used instead.
 *
 * ### Not stable for inheritance
 *
 * `SerialDescriptor` interface is not stable for inheritance in 3rd party libraries, as new methods
 * might be added to this interface or contracts of the existing methods can be changed.
 * This interface is safe to build using [buildClassSerialDescriptor] and [PrimitiveSerialDescriptor],
 * and is safe to delegate implementation to existing instances.
