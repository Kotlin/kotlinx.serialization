/**
 * Serial kind is an intrinsic property of [SerialDescriptor] that indicates how
 * the corresponding type is structurally represented by its serializer.
 *
 * Kind is used by serialization formats to determine how exactly the given type
 * should be serialized. For example, JSON format detects the kind of the value and,
 * depending on that, may write it as a plain value for primitive kinds, open a
 * curly brace '{' for class-like structures and square bracket '[' for list- and array- like structures.
 *
 * Kinds are used both in runtime, to serialize a value properly and statically,
 * to retrospect the type structure or build serialization schema.
 *
 * Kind should match the structure of the serialized form, not the structure of the corresponding Kotlin class.
 * Meaning that if serializable class `class IntPair(val left: Int, val right: Int)` is represented by the serializer
 * as a single `Long` value, its descriptor should have [PrimitiveKind.LONG] without nested elements even though the class itself
 * represents a structure with two primitive fields.

/**
 * Values of primitive kinds that usually are represented as a single value.
 * All default serializers for Kotlin [primitives types](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-for-py/primitive-data-types-and-their-limitations.html)
 * and [String] have primitive kind.
 *
 * ### Serializers interaction
 *
 * Serialization formats typically handle these kinds by calling a corresponding primitive method on encoder or decoder.
 * For example, if the following serializable class `class Color(val red: Byte, val green: Byte, val blue: Byte)` is represented by your serializer
 * as a single [Int] value, a typical serializer will serialize its value in the following manner:
 * ```
 * val intValue = color.rgbToInt()
 * encoder.encodeInt()
 * ```
 * and a corresponding [Decoder] counterpart.
 *
 * ### Implementation note
 *
 * Serial descriptors for primitive kinds are not expected to have any nested elements, thus its element count should be zero.
 * If a class is represented as a primitive value, its corresponding serial name *should not* be equal to the corresponding primitive type name.
 * For the `Color` example, represented as single [Int], its descriptor should have [INT] kind, zero elements and serial name **not equals**
 * to `kotlin.Int`: `PrimitiveDescriptor("my.package.ColorAsInt", PrimitiveKind.INT)`

/**
 * Structure kind represents values with composite structure of nested elements of depth and arbitrary number.
 * We acknowledge three structured kinds:
 *
 * ### Regular classes
 * The most common case for serialization, that represents an arbitrary structure with fixed count of elements.
 * When the regular Kotlin class is marked as [Serializable], its descriptor kind will be [CLASS].
 *
 * ### Lists
 * [LIST] represent a structure with potentially unknown in advance number of elements of the same type.
 * All standard serializable [List] implementors are represented as [LIST] kind of the same type.
 *
 * ### Maps
 * [MAP] represent a structure with potentially unknown in advance number of key-value pairs of the same type.
 * All standard serializable [Map] implementors are represented as [Map] kind of the same type.
 *
 * ### Serializers interaction
 * Serialization formats typically handle these kinds by marking structure start and end.
 * E.g. the following serializable class `class IntHolder(myValue: Int)` of structure kind [CLASS] is handled by
 * serializer as the following call sequence:
 * ```
 * val composite = encoder.beginStructure(descriptor) // Denotes the start of the structure
 * composite.encodeIntElement(descriptor, index = 0, holder.myValue)
 * composite.beginStructure(descriptor) // Denotes the end of the structure
 * ```
 * and its corresponding [Decoder] counterpart.
 *
 * ### Serial descriptor implementors note
 * These kinds can be used not only for collection and regular classes.
 * For example, provided serializer for [Map.Entry] represents it as [Map] type, so it is serialized
 * as `{"actualKey": "actualValue"}` map directly instead of `{"key": "actualKey", "value": "actualValue"}`
